<h2 align="center">A Weakly Supervised Framework for Appliance Localization in Smart-Meter Series</h2>

Improving smart grid system management is crucial in the fight against climate change, and enabling consumers to play an active role in this effort is a significant challenge for electricity suppliers. 
In this regard, millions of smart meters have been deployed worldwide in the last decade, recording the main electricity power consumed in individual households.
This data produces valuable information that can help them reduce their electricity footprint; nevertheless, the collected signal aggregates the consumption of the different appliances running simultaneously in the house, making it difficult to apprehend.
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) refers to the challenge of estimating the power consumption, pattern, or on/off state activation of individual appliances using the main smart meter signal.
Recent methods proposed to tackle this task are based on a fully supervised deep-learning approach that requires both the aggregate signal and the ground truth of individual appliance power.
However, such labels are expensive to collect and extremely scarce in practice, as they require conducting intrusive surveys in households to monitor each appliance.
In this paper, we introduce CamAL, a weakly supervised approach for appliance pattern localization that only requires information on the presence of an appliance in a household to be trained.
